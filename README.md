# NMT_LSTM_Transformers
Neural Machine Translation with LSTM and Attention Mechanisms

Developed and evaluated three LSTM-based and one transformer-based neural machine translation models using the WMT16 dataset, demonstrating that the transformer model, with a trainable layer, outperformed the LSTM variants in translation quality.
